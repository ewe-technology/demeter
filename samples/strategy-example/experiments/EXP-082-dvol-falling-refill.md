# EXP-082: refill stages only while implied volatility is falling (v6.69)

- Jira: QUAN-___
- Status: pre-registered
- Pre-registration commit: ______ · Result commit: ______
- Scope: /goal round 2 (Dino, 2026-10-05: "再繼續找30個"): beat v6 at the improvement level on ETH and WBTC, pure LP, time-split
  out-of-time holdout; idle-capital yield and swap routing excluded (rulings / assumption of 2026-10-05).

## Hypothesis

An LP is short volatility (LVR grows with σ², Milionis et al. 2022). v6's staged refill — its core edge (EXP-067/068) — fires on price alone, so it also redeploys into dead-cat bounces while the options market still prices a further shock. Requiring Deribit's DVOL to be falling when a stage fires keeps the refills on rebounds where the shock is being priced out (after the May 2021 crash and the June 2022 Celsius / 3AC lows DVOL peaked after the price low). New information (options market), acts only on refill timing, not on recentring.

## Change

`REFILL_GATE = "dvol_turn"` (variant `BU`): a refill stage (any of the four) fires only if the 3-day mean of the asset's DVOL is below its value 3 days earlier; days without DVOL never block. Everything else is v6's. Constants: the 3-day window (the refill's own confirmation length).

## Pre-registration

Pre-registered together with EXP-082..086 (same commit), run in one invocation per window with `A` (v6): `A,BU,BV,BW,BX,BY`. EXP-083 and EXP-084 share the accelerator and are near-copies.

- Development (in-sample): ETH/USDC 0.05% mainnet yearly segments 2022, 2023, 2024, 2025, 2026-01-01..09-17 and continuous
  2022-01-01..2026-09-17; WBTC/USDC 0.3% mainnet continuous 2022-11-01..2026-09-17.
- Holdout (run once, `A` and the variant, only if dev passes): **time-split out-of-time**, both windows before the dev windows,
  warm-up from Binance daily closes (`BINANCE_WARM=1`): H5 ETH/USDC 0.05% 2021-05-06..2021-12-31; H4 WBTC/USDC 0.3%
  2022-01-01..2022-10-31. v6's numbers there are known (EXP-040..081) and both windows have been used for other variants; this
  variant never ran there.
- Success rule (improvement level only; `judge.py dev` and `judge.py oot`):
  - Dev: continuous ETH and WBTC each CAGR above v6's, Calmar ≥ v6's, max DD no more than 3 pts deeper; ETH yearly wins ≥ 3
    of 5. Fails → `dropped-at-dev`.
  - Holdout: on H5 and on H4 each, CAGR above v6's, Calmar ≥ v6's (if v6's CAGR is negative: CAGR above only) and max DD no
    more than 3 pts deeper → `holdout-pass`; otherwise `holdout-fail`.

## Result

(pending)

## Deviations

- Ideas from a literature pass of 2026-10-05 (fourth agent run; it suggested screening the signals on dev refill events before pre-registering, which was not done, to keep dev unseen). New inputs: `samples/deribit_dvol_daily.csv` (`fetch_deribit_dvol.py`, Deribit DVOL from 2021-03-24), `binance_funding_{ETH,BTC}USDT_long.csv` (from 2020-06). Engine sanity check before this file (F statistics only, no strategy run): Binance ETH closes 2020-06..2021-04 and 2021-06..2023-06 (the second range overlaps dev: F means and change counts were seen, no returns). The first DVOL rule (3-day mean below the peak since exit) could never block — a mean cannot exceed the max it includes — and was replaced by the falling-DVOL rule below before this file.
